I am eager to tell you all that I’m back\!&nbsp;

I never actually went anywhere, but about two years ago **I was given the rare and exciting opportunity to become the broker and manager of Yuma’s number one real estate company: ERA Matt Fisher Realtor.** That has been an unbelievable experience and growth opportunity for me. However, due to the time commitment required to learn my new role and responsibilities, it tore me away from working with my core group of clients, and my ability to assist them with their real estate needs. Now, two years later, I’m up and running there and everything’s going great.&nbsp;

So, I wanted to send you this message and reveal that I’m enthusiastic about once again serving and engaging with my friends, family, and all my past clients. I hope to have the future opportunity to assist you and your real estate needs. If I lost touch with you over the last couple of years, I apologize, but I also promise to give my best effort in keeping you up-to-date with the Yuma real estate market moving forward by presenting you with local market statistics, sales reports specific to your subdivision and area, and other local real estate trends and topics important to Yuma homeowners like yourself.&nbsp;

If there’s something in addition to what I just mentioned that you would find beneficial, **reach out to me with any suggestions**. I’m excited to grow my new real estate team and provide the best service to the people who are most important to me, and that’s people like yourself.&nbsp;

If you or anyone you know is currently in the market to buy or sell a home, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email so I can take care of them. I look forward to helping you. Keep your eyes open for future educational videos and information that I’ll be sending your way\!<br>&nbsp;
