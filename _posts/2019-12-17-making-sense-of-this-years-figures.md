Someone I know asks me about the overall status of the real estate market on an almost daily basis. So, for today’s video, I figured I’d take the time to explain what’s been going on in the market here in Yuma, Arizona.&nbsp;

On a quarterly basis, I put together a Yuma market report that shows all the stats, year-to-date versus the previous year. I’ll be sharing this compiled data from January 2019 through September 2019. For these reports, I use three metrics: **single-family homes, manufactured homes, and condominiums.**
