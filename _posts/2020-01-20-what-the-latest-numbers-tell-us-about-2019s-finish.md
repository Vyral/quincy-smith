Welcome to 2020\! I hope that 2019 was your best year to date, you had a wonderful holiday season, and you’re 2020 is even more blessed.&nbsp;

We just finished our first company sales meeting of the new year where we took a deep dive into the latest statistics. We’ve been working toward a clearer forecast for what’s ahead in 2020 by comparing what happened in the 2019 market to years prior.&nbsp;

In our monthly sales report, we focus on single-family homes with a Yuma address and track two things for each month dating back five years: **the number of listings taken and the number of listings sold.** With this report, we determine our sales rate (i.e., divide the number of homes sold by the listings taken).

For 2019, we had a nearly 70% sales rate, a fantastic number. Looking back at the averages over the past five years, the sales rate has been 65.2%, representing several consecutive years of a strong market. **This jump up to 70% is what’s causing our extremely low inventory levels in most price ranges.**&nbsp;

The low inventory makes it a very good time to be a home seller in Yuma, Arizona. Buyers, however, still have plenty to get excited about in this market; historically low interest rates mean buyers could lock in a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at around 4%.&nbsp;

Every year, we look at our monthly sales reports and notice a downtick in demand stretching from September through January or February. Fall is when parents are busy running kids to school events and extracurricular activities, and soon after come the late fall/early winter holidays. Simply put, families are prioritizing everything else but real estate.&nbsp;

Then, in late January, we see a pent-up demand emerge from buyers in the market. That’s why March through August are the months in which we realize the most sales. Make no mistake: People are starting to look now and prepare themselves for early spring activity.&nbsp;

These were just a few of the insights gleaned from this report. If you reach out to me by phone or email, I’m happy to share it with you. Also, don’t hesitate to mention any questions you may have about our 2020 market. Overall, we’re predicting another strong market year\!
